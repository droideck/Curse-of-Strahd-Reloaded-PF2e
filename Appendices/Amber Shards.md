Throughout the adventure, the players will have the opportunity to obtain one or more *amber shards*—fragments of the amber sarcophagi that imprison the vestiges of the Amber Temple.

Though they don't carry the full essence of the vestiges, each amber shard bears a psychic link to the sarcophagus from which it came. Through that link, a vestige can whisper to the shard's holder, offering promises of power in exchange for descent into corruption.

> [!info]+ **Finding Amber Shards**
> The players have an opportunity to obtain an amber shard:
> * during [[Character Creation]]
> * optionally, during [[Arc A - Escape From Death House]]
> * after defeating Izek Strazni in [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] / [[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings]] (see [[#Seriach, the Hell Hound Whisperer]])
> * after raiding the Castle Ravenloft treasury in [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]] (see [[#Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer]])
> * following Scorilo if he loses the boasting match in [[Arc R - Trials of the Mountain]] (see [[#Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm]])
> * after defeating the bodaks in [[Arc R - Trials of the Mountain]] (see [[#Sykane, the Soul Hungerer]])
> * within the [[Arc R - Trials of the Mountain#The Cave of Daggers|Cave of Daggers]] (see [[#Yog the Invincible]])
> * from the **nothic** Meda in [[Arc S - A Sword of Sunlight]] (see [[#Khirad, the Star of Secrets]])
>
> You should carefully consider adding additional shards for the players to obtain. VERY CAREFULLY.

> [!info]+ **The Magic of the Shards**
> A player who scrutinizes an amber shard with a *detect magic* spell discerns tinges of abjuration magic. A player who attempts to identify a shard with an *identify* spell learns that it was once a part of a larger framework meant to contain or imprison some entity or creature, and that it still retains some arcane link to the original container.

> [!info]+ **Why Amber?**
> A player who succeeds on a DC 22 Arcana check recalls that amber has a unique magical property: it is a magical “insulator," and cannot be damaged or crossed by any kind of energy, be it magical or divine. On a result of 20 or more, the player further recalls that magical energies can pass through amber only very slowly, on a timescale of years to decades.

> This campaign uses the Pathfinder 2e War of Immortals [alternative](https://downloads.paizo.com/PZO12006AlternateMythicRules.pdf) [Mythic Rules](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3320). The vestiges serve as the source of mythic power, acting as patrons who grant Callings and eventually Destinies to those who accept their gifts. While the vestiges oppose Strahd, their methods and goals are often questionable, representing the complex morality reminiscent of the gods in Pillars of Eternity.

> The stages below are equal Mythic Tiers.

# Mythic Progression Through the Shards

## Stage 0 - The Call to Power

When a character possessing an amber shard reaches dying 4 (or at another dramatically appropriate moment), they receive a vision of their potential vestige patron. The being offers power and purpose, presenting the character with a choice to accept a mythic Calling. This moment should emphasize both the vestige's opposition to Strahd and hint at their morally ambiguous nature.

## Stages 1-3 - Awakening Power

During these stages, the character begins to manifest mythic abilities according to their Calling, but communication with their vestige patron is limited and cryptic. The shard's power grows alongside the character's mythic tier, granting access to mythic feats and abilities as per the War of Immortals rules.
In Stage 3, the character gets an Unholy trait.

## Stages 4-5 - The Vestige Speaks

The vestige becomes more active in communicating with their chosen, revealing more of their true nature and goals. They begin actively encouraging the character to seek out the Amber Temple, promising greater power through a mythic Destiny. These conversations should reveal the complex motivations of the vestiges - their opposition to Strahd is genuine, but their methods may be troubling.
This stage presents some minor but noticeable body and ability changes. Consider using [Blighted Boons](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=104) (but make it less powerful - remove fast healing, etc.), or [Aftermath Feats](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Traits=424), or [Deviant Abilities](https://2e.aonprd.com/DeviantFeats.aspx).

## Stages 6-7 - The Price of Power

These represent the maximum achievable tiers in the campaign. Characters who accept their vestige's offered Destiny gain tremendous power but face a dark fate. Players must understand and accept OOC that reaching these stages means their character will likely be lost to darkness after the campaign's conclusion. This should be roleplayed as a tragic fall in service of a greater purpose.
The person's body changes drastically according to the patron's theme. It might include more powerful [Blighted Boons](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=104) but, in the Epilogue, the character will be lost and it will become something else.
# Vestiges as Patrons

Each vestige should:

- Have clear goals that oppose Strahd's rule
- Present morally complex choices to their chosen
- Demonstrate both wisdom and concerning traits
- Offer power while revealing the price of that power
- Match thematically with available mythic Callings

Remember that vestiges are not necessarily evil, but their long imprisonment and ancient nature make their morality alien and often troubling to mortals. They may genuinely wish to help Barovia while still pursuing goals that mortals would find disturbing.

Still, some vestiges are pure darkness. Use them wisely.

> [!info]+ **Progression Notes**
>
> - Players can complete deeds in different orders, but certain story-dependent deeds must follow the campaign's natural progression
> - Some deeds are optional but completing them will result in more power in key moments
> - Additional opportunities for mythic deeds may arise based on character actions and vestige influences (but be careful about the power curve it will give)

## The Path of Redemption

Players can break free from their vestige's influence and pursue a "good" mythic path by:

- Reconsecrating the fanes
- Redeeming the Abbot
- Other acts of profound redemption

This alternative path still grants mythic power but transforms the character's Calling and potential Destiny to reflect their rejection of dark power.

You should tailor these to your player's stories. Guide will not help here as it's too individual.

# Running Mythic Elements

- Major antagonists (and sometimes their minions) connected to Strahd, the Amber Temple, and the Dark Powers should be mythic creatures
- Award both hero point and mythic point regularly, but mythic characters should get additional points for mythic deeds and defeating mythic monsters.
- Provide regular opportunities for mythic deeds to restore Mythic Points.
  Especially in Act IV.
- Use mythic encounters to emphasize the supernatural horror of Barovia
- Integrate mythic elements into major story beats, especially around the Amber Temple
